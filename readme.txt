Amylona is a variant of the roguelike game Elonapluscustom, which is itself a variant of Elonaplus which is a variant of Elona. This variant is created by AmyBSOD. Many thanks to Noa (author of Elona), Ano (author of Elonaplus) and AnnaBannana (author of Elonapluscustom) for all the work you put into creating the game!

How to use this variant: Download Elonaplus with the corresponding custom patch, and use diff or something to apply my changes to source.hsp, then compile via the Hot Soup Processor compiler. The resulting executable is then used to launch the game. Have fun!
