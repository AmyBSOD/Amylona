Amylona is a variant of the roguelike game Elonapluscustom, which is itself a variant of Elonaplus which is a variant of Elona. This variant is created by AmyBSOD. Many thanks to Noa (author of Elona), Ano (author of Elonaplus) and AnnaBannana (author of Elonapluscustom) for all the work you put into creating the game!

How to use this variant: Download Elonaplus with the corresponding custom patch, and copy the Amylona.exe into the main folder. This is the executable used to launch the game. You can verify it by looking at the window title, which should say "Amylona". Have fun!
