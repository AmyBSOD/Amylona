- Skill/spell/stat potential decreases by 15% when they go up (used to be 21% but that was just way too fast, it shouldn't be that you pump up the potential to 400% and then it's all gone after upping the skill three times or so). Training a skill via platinum coins gives 50% more potential (used to be 100%). Sleeping restores spell potentials by 25% (used to be 30%). Pets that train their skills by spending money in town will receive considerably less training, since it was simply too easy for them to max out their potentials later on due to the costs never going up no matter how high their skills become.
- All monsters can always use gauge attacks, even when not playing in No Future mode (am I the only one who thinks the name changes they made to the modes are really bullshit? "Loss" or "Abnormal" just sound stupid, sorry!).
- Some shops can now stock "bad" items like potions of confusion or scrolls of inferior material.
- Acid damage can always destroy equipment if it gets damaged enough, even when not playing in No Future mode. After all, you'd have to be quite the noob to let your kickass artifact get hit by acid that many times, so if you do, you deserve to lose it.
- Spellcasting success chance can always reach 100%, no matter how heavy the player's equipment is and no matter what kind of equipment is in the second hand slot. Because I really HATE HATE HATE that bloody cap that basically forced me into using light armor and only a single melee weapon without a shield. To compensate, the spellcasting success rate is lowered even more with medium/heavy armor now, but at least now the penalty can eventually be overcome with enough skill!
- The Disarm Trap skill will train much more quickly. Seriously, did anyone except me ever notice how ultra-slowly it trains since there's no feasible way to farm traps considering how rare they are? I used to resort to dragging a tame mine dog along to generate mines to disarm, one should really not have to do that to raise the skill...
- The player no longer loses their equipment upon death. That always ticked me off to no end! Whose ingenious idea was it to make it so that you could just randomly lose that sentient weapon you spent hundreds of hours to level, or that precious item that would require you to farm 10 big daddies to get back? And why didn't they make it possible to turn that bullshit off??? I mean, I get it that if you somehow get stuck with a bloodsucking item that will simply kill you again, the chance of dropping it upon death might be a lifesaver, but... I say the possibility of such a situation is a small price to pay for what is ultimately going to make the game much more enjoyable. Heck, I committed actual cheating to work around the problem of dropping (and thereby permanently losing) my items when I died in the wilderness. This is my variant, and I decide what it's supposed to be like. Call me a cheater, I don't care!
- "Rare" drops by certain enemies actually are rare again. I remember a version where it used to be something special to get an unknown shell, a happy bed, or a secret experience of Kumiromi. But somehow the devs decided to make those drops ultra common. Should it really be that everyone has an unknown shell by XL5 and half a dozen happy beds by XL20? Nope, I say!
- Reverted some of the bloody "fixes" to certain "spelling errors". The curased coffin shall forever be spelled "curased coffin", and everyone who disagrees with me shall be put in a curased coffin as well! Just kidding :P Also reinstated the "yerles conbat plane" spelling.
- Replaced the broken "keh-la keh-la keh-la keh-la keh-la keh-la" bullshit that would permanently remove my metal pianist's superb magic resistance with no way to get it back. Now, that dream instead increases the ether corruption. Here's a very big middle finger to whoever created that creepy dream. Your silliness will never hurt my metal pianist again.
- Nerfed violent garden damage by dividing it by 10. It's just ridiculous how overpowered that action is, I started dubbing it "screen-wide total annihilation" because that's what it is. Rogue ambush? Just spam it a couple of times and all the flunkies are dead. Spam it some more and chances are the rogue boss will also expire before your stamina does. Like, did they even test it when they put it into the game??? No special action should be that strong, I even started to avoid the magical plants feat on purpose to ensure the game doesn't become too easy...
- Buying additional limbs at Gavela has a fixed cost because seriously, what were they thinking??? Penalizing the player for eating their hero cheese early is just so incredibly retarded, and the strategy would devolve into "stock up on hero cheese without eating them, buy limb, then eat them to get the lost life back", plus it would mean debug races with high starting Life wouldn't really benefit all that much of their high stat since it's all lost when buying more limbs. No longer, I say!
- The corpse of musical notadpoles conveys sound resistance. It really made no sense that there wasn't a single monster that did so while all other resistances can be gotten that way.
