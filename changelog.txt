Sixth commit:
- The pokeball change was not working correctly and is fixed now.
- The aggravate monster change was not working correctly and is fixed now.

Fifth commit:
- Added a (fake) DYWYPI prompt when the character dies.

Fourth commit:
- Renamed the "godly" string from pseudo-identified items to "ubergodly" to remove the issue where it's easy to mistake them for useless "Good" items.
- Standard monster AI will perform ranged attacks at a distance of 7 squares. I can't believe that custom AI limitation existed for the regular monster AI too, but apparently it did, so I could just have killed Utima early by keeping 6-7 squares distance, dismissing all the pets, and plugging away with my gun until Utima is dead. I won't have such cheesy tactics in *my* game, thank you very much.

1.73-specific:
- Re-inserted the old method of determining how many small medals the player gets for completing a random dungeon. But the new method that awards fixed amounts for high-difficulty dungeons is still there, too.

Third commit:
- Healing and Meditation skills will always train when they should. It is completely arbitrary bullshit that they just wouldn't train when your (irrelevant) constitution/magic stat was lower than the skill value, no other skill is treated like that AFAIK, and if it is, I will fix it for whatever other skills afflicted by this disease, too!

Second commit:
- Added a periodic chime noise if the player's gauge meter is full. This is far from perfect, but previously there was no indication at all that you had reached your maximum gauge!
- Low hitpoint warning sound happens when below 50% max HP, since below 25% was way too low. There are things that can kill you in two hits and not everyone is OCD enough to constantly keep a close eye on that not-really-very-obvious-when-it-decreases HP bar! Why can't we simply have a hit point bar *directly underneath our character sprite* just like stethoscoped pets do???
- Aggravate monster will spawn monsters based on the level of whoever is wearing an item with that effect because there's no reason to rubberband it to the player character's level.
- "Rare" items that may sometimes be generated as starting inventories of certain monsters are rare again. See comment below about rare drops.
- Items with "protects you from thieves" protects you from the malicious hand too because seriously, that bullshit needs to be stopped. If I'm protected from thieves then I expect to be fucking protected from thieves! The property is rare enough already, I won't accept it if it doesn't work!
- Remove the fucked up "anti-savescumming" feature. Sorry, dear developer, I'm not the kind of player you had in mind when you designed that "feature". And besides, your "feature" hurts non-savescumming players too by penalizing them for saving and loading the game often - you don't always have that much time for playing in one block, and I in particular don't want to leave the game running when I'm afk for a longer period of time since my PC has a habit of crashing and I don't want to lose my savegame file! And you want to penalize me for that every time, by making it so that I get 10 minutes of "no good item can ever drop"? Seriously???
- Custom AI pets can attack at a range of up to 7 squares. I'll never understand the reasoning for that completely arbitrary limit, much less that the one who introduced it is vehemently defending it. Goodbye, silly restriction, remove your fat ass from my beloved game or I will remove it permanently! Oh wait, I just did. Good riddance. :P
- Memorization un-trashed by making it affect dreams, wonder scrolls and mana battery again. Whoever thought it was a good idea to trash a skill that was already not very useful to begin with??? I mean, the amount it increses spell stock gain isn't great even now, but at least it's more than zero! Dear original developer, I guess you don't like the nether wave spell for some reason but I do!
- Pokeballs work when the monster is below 20% health (was 10%). It was just too damn annoying to whittle down the monster without killing it, I know there's the knockout feat but I feel it shouldn't be such a pain in the butt without it.
- Don't permanently remove act 1 void lords from the list once the player reaches act 2. How many players would enter the void before offing Zeome, anyway? It just seems very silly to limit a bunch of bosses like that, since few players would ever encounter them.

First commit:
- Skill/spell/stat potential decreases by 15% when they go up (used to be 21% but that was just way too fast, it shouldn't be that you pump up the potential to 400% and then it's all gone after upping the skill three times or so). Training a skill via platinum coins gives 50% more potential (used to be 100%). Sleeping restores spell potentials by 25% (used to be 30%). Pets that train their skills by spending money in town will receive considerably less training, since it was simply too easy for them to max out their potentials later on due to the costs never going up no matter how high their skills become.
- All monsters can always use gauge attacks, even when not playing in No Future mode (am I the only one who thinks the name changes they made to the modes are really bullshit? "Loss" or "Abnormal" just sound stupid, sorry!).
- Some shops can now stock "bad" items like potions of confusion or scrolls of inferior material.
- Acid damage can always destroy equipment if it gets damaged enough, even when not playing in No Future mode. After all, you'd have to be quite the noob to let your kickass artifact get hit by acid that many times, so if you do, you deserve to lose it.
- Spellcasting success chance can always reach 100%, no matter how heavy the player's equipment is and no matter what kind of equipment is in the second hand slot. Because I really HATE HATE HATE that bloody cap that basically forced me into using light armor and only a single melee weapon without a shield. To compensate, the spellcasting success rate is lowered even more with medium/heavy armor now, but at least now the penalty can eventually be overcome with enough skill!
- The Disarm Trap skill will train much more quickly. Seriously, did anyone except me ever notice how ultra-slowly it trains since there's no feasible way to farm traps considering how rare they are? I used to resort to dragging a tame mine dog along to generate mines to disarm, one should really not have to do that to raise the skill...
- The player no longer loses their equipment upon death. That always ticked me off to no end! Whose ingenious idea was it to make it so that you could just randomly lose that sentient weapon you spent hundreds of hours to level, or that precious item that would require you to farm 10 big daddies to get back? And why didn't they make it possible to turn that bullshit off??? I mean, I get it that if you somehow get stuck with a bloodsucking item that will simply kill you again, the chance of dropping it upon death might be a lifesaver, but... I say the possibility of such a situation is a small price to pay for what is ultimately going to make the game much more enjoyable. Heck, I committed actual cheating to work around the problem of dropping (and thereby permanently losing) my items when I died in the wilderness. This is my variant, and I decide what it's supposed to be like. Call me a cheater, I don't care!
- "Rare" drops by certain enemies actually are rare again. I remember a version where it used to be something special to get an unknown shell, a happy bed, or a secret experience of Kumiromi. But somehow the devs decided to make those drops ultra common. Should it really be that everyone has an unknown shell by XL5 and half a dozen happy beds by XL20? Nope, I say!
- Reverted some of the bloody "fixes" to certain "spelling errors". The curased coffin shall forever be spelled "curased coffin", and everyone who disagrees with me shall be put in a curased coffin as well! Just kidding :P Also reinstated the "yerles conbat plane" spelling.
- Replaced the broken "keh-la keh-la keh-la keh-la keh-la keh-la" bullshit that would permanently remove my metal pianist's superb magic resistance with no way to get it back. Now, that dream instead increases the ether corruption. Here's a very big middle finger to whoever created that creepy dream. Your silliness will never hurt my metal pianist again.
- Nerfed violent garden damage by dividing it by 10. It's just ridiculous how overpowered that action is, I started dubbing it "screen-wide total annihilation" because that's what it is. Rogue ambush? Just spam it a couple of times and all the flunkies are dead. Spam it some more and chances are the rogue boss will also expire before your stamina does. Like, did they even test it when they put it into the game??? No special action should be that strong, I even started to avoid the magical plants feat on purpose to ensure the game doesn't become too easy...
- Buying additional limbs at Gavela has a fixed cost because seriously, what were they thinking??? Penalizing the player for eating their hero cheese early is just so incredibly retarded, and the strategy would devolve into "stock up on hero cheese without eating them, buy limb, then eat them to get the lost life back", plus it would mean debug races with high starting Life wouldn't really benefit all that much of their high stat since it's all lost when buying more limbs. No longer, I say!
- The corpse of musical notadpoles conveys sound resistance. It really made no sense that there wasn't a single monster that did so while all other resistances can be gotten that way.
