The dates given use the German format of day.month.year because that's the only correct format :P

16.8.2020
- Added a bunch of new recipes for the four crafting skills that the player can use. Be sure to check in-game for new items that the carpentry tool, sewing kit, alchemy set and gem cutter can manufacture. Some of these items require a rather high skill level.
- The directive technique can now be used on unseen pets by default because it's such a HUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE pain in the ass if you can't, and having to wait until you can kill a certain uberboss NPC in act 3 before you finally gain the ability to use directive properly just plain sucks.
- Many skills that used to simply train waaaaaay too slowly will train faster now, and the player no longer gets a nonsensical penalty for stat gains from eating food (it used to be that the player only gained one fifth the amount that a pet got!).
- Monsters that split can now give AP when killed, because the split clones don't give AP anyway and so this cannot be used for lame farming exploits, and if the monster's speed INI exactly matches the party member's speed INI, it can also give AP now (it used to be that the monster's value had to be higher, now it's higher-or-equal). This means that gaining AP is slightly easier now.
- The mutation spell can now be taught to pets.
- Many spells whose effects scale with spell level will scale better now.
- Thanks to code from Elonapluscustom-G, a lot of untranslated dialogue is translated now.
- Throwing weapons can now be used in combination with ammo too. No longer does the player have to leave the ammo slot free! All types of ammo (arrows, bolts, firearm ammo) work with throwing weapons.
- Magnum ammo can now be used with all guns. It made no sense that it only worked for one particularly crappy type of firearm that no one uses.
- Many magical affixes can appear on more types of equipment now, and the strength of random-strength enchantments can occasionally be much higher. This is done to ensure that miracle and ubergodly equipment actually remains interesting to check out because occasionally these items can roll really cool modifiers now. Potentially ones that make them stronger than fixed artifacts, even.
- Pets can carry furniture and junk now because who the hell had the bright idea that pets could just say "no i wont carry that"? It's soooooo stupid! Of course they can carry such items!
- Since pokeballing custom NPCs has never worked properly and due to someone not giving me the actual source code, it no longer works at all now, so the glitchiness has been "sealed away" so to speak. Sadly, using the astral light pen on unique custom NPCs is still ultra bugged.
- Pets with crafting skills craft furniture instead of equipment now. Player crafting has already been changed to no longer produce equipment, so for the sake of consistency and also because at some point they only ever make lame fairy hats and stupid plate mails anyway, pets no longer do either.

15.5.2020
- The rod of domination can now be recharged because after all the spellbook can too.
- Certain unique items that used to not generate randomly, e.g. the Mani pistol, hero cheese or the license of the void explorer, can occasionally spawn randomly now, including in the inventory of adventurer NPCs.
- Restored the previously broken level scaling for custom NPCs.
- Of course you can save during the Enthumesis/Orphe-"chaos child lol level 3500 lol" fight. Who is the devil that decided to make it a "feature" that in a game where you can ALWAYS suspend save at your leisure, you suddenly can't???

15.4.2019
- Custom NPCs scale correctly in the Void now. They still don't work correctly with panic/challenge quests etc. because the devs are lazy fucks that don't care about broken code and I, the only person in the world who does care, don't know how to fix it :P
- If the player casts a spell, they can now spray the powder/vibrate/etc. depending on their casting style, just like monsters can.
- More item affixes: resist acid/ether/etc. (not sure whether they actually do something), + to luck/life/mana, made certain very rare item attributes more common etc.
- Using code from ICannotNameAnything, backported the ability to interact with your steed and a bugfix because the E+ devs can't fix their shit :P
- Sentient weapons no longer have only one random attribute on generation. Instead, they can get a full suite just like other miracle-quality items.
- Being hit by salt while playing a snail will force a --More-- now. Fuck you whoever thought it was a good idea to not have that confirmation :P
- The damage done by shining wave is less insane.

20.12.2018
- More special actions and spells can be learned by pets now because some of the banned ones were really arbitrary. Over Long Throw not allowed for pets? WTF???
- Since I can't correctly fix Blade Strings (by making it so that you can never get disarm trap experience), I made it consistent so that you always get disarm trap experience. It would be up to the Elona devs to fix that, but I'm not hopeful...
- Smash Ground now does random damage, but the maximum damage it can do was not reduced, unlike the "official" new versions.
- Wiped the anti-fun feature where custom NPCs would get god recruitment penalties when their stat INIs were higher than some arbitrary value. Like what the actual fuck was that for, really. You don't get penalties when dominating a grass killer, so why the hell do you give me one when dominating a madling. Gotta fix that shit.

2.10.2018
- The change that made it so that town identify services have little baby prices (i.e. they became so cheap that I couldn't help but feel that the main player base the devs want to cater to is little babies) should now be reverted.
- Lock Break now displays meaningful messages.
- Having more than 2 melee attacks will no longer trash those extra attacks beyond belief for no apparent reason.
- Death Word takes longer to kill a chara quality up pet (due to a bug, it would kill the pet more quickly than without the quality up!).
- Chaos forts no longer give their absolutely boring-as-hell difficulty rating and were reverted to the much better 666 and 999 displays.

23.8.2018
- Summoned monsters now get the summoned flag even if they're neutral, because seriously, farming is so lame. You'd even be able to farm AP by getting a sufficiently high summon monster spell to pull dragon centipedes and whatever the heck that bat's name was...
- More monsters can give resistances when eaten: <Ebon> the fire giant, suzaku, lava golem and araonibi grant fire resistance. xeren electric tank and electric hippopotamus grant lightning resistance. <Chaos Unicorn> King of Chaos grants chaos resistance. hel and blizzard lizard grant cold resistance. meida grants sound resistance. oyaukamui grants nether resistance. darknesslug grants darkness resistance. gigantic fairy grants magic resistance.

18.8.2018
- Death Word and certain other "you die now" effects do 9999999 instead of 9999 damage to ensure that the target really dies.
- Houses, storages etc. can hold more items.
- Harvest Time quests in particular, but also Challenge and Panic, can spawn higher-level monsters and are harder.
- Increased the 240 limit for the # of custom NPCs to 10000, I hope this won't break things.
- Bashing a monster that goes "click" to explode will remove its "I will explode at the next opportunity" flag. This allows bomb rocks and similar stuff to be used as pets without them constantly blowing up.

4.7.2018
- Made the inane combo system do nothing. If the enemy is such a wimp and allows you to hit him 200 times before he gets another turn, it's his own fault and he shall not get arbitrary damage reduction!

- Recharging an item really has an additional chance of the recharged item exploding.
- Certain skills and spells are no longer impossible to train when used on a monster that can split. Here's another big "fook yoo" to the morons who thought it was a good idea to make all those 200 scythe/bow hits wasted when fighting a spritzit pawn. I'm spending a lot of time killing those and I don't "pudding farm" them, so I demand to be given my well-earned experience points dammit!

Ninth commit:
- Certain skills and spells are no longer impossible to train when there's a summoned monster nearby. Here's a big "fook yoo" to whoever thought it was a good idea to make healing rain not train if among the 12 monsters in the radius there's a single one that got summoned. I spent valuable spell stocks to cast that spell so GIVE ME MY DAMN SPELL SKILL TRAINING BITCHES.
- Recharging an item has an additional chance of the recharged item exploding. It was far too easy to amass a ton of Dominate spell stock!
- The platinum cost for learning a new skill no longer goes up if you use a skill ticket because wtf, what were the devs thinking there.
- Reverted the new (stupid) lines for Tam the Cat Hater to the (much better) older ones. Dear translators, why do you keep screwing things up? There was no missing I in the line " hate those bloody cats!" Everyone who tries to remove the unique Engrish charm of this beautiful game is a filthy heretic and here's my " hate those filthy translator heretics!" for you! :P

Eighth commit (version 1.76):
- When the player dies, all attributes are damaged, even if the death was in a quest. If you die for real, the amount of attribute damage is much higher. Yes, this attribute damage includes speed, life, mana and luck. This is not a joke and will not be reverted. After all, there should be *some* penalty for death, and we got rid of the very obnoxious "lol ur level 10 sentient weapon has vanished" and "sux2bu ur sages helm just got vaporized trololololololo" bullshit which is IMHO way more annoying than losing a few stat points that you can just grind back up anyway.
- Panic and challenge quests can always appear, regardless of the player's fame, and spawn slightly higher-level monsters. Hunting as well as Beauty and the Beast quests are no longer illogically capped at a difficulty of 16 $ (which means monsters of level 80), because that was probably a relic of vanilla Elona times where there are no monsters with base levels higher than that.
- Hermes blood and AP will give much lower boosts to speed.
- Zombies can once again drop potions of descent.
- The player no longer learns the grossly overpowered Shining Wave, Blood Stream and Mana Burst abilities. Shadow Step and Dimension Fishing are more expensive to use. Shadow Step requires 100 Tactics skill to learn. Houzanha mines less tiles per use.

Seventh commit:
- Custom AI now allows you to set a percentage proc chance for every action, thanks to a kind modder named Shad3Light whose code I stole shamelessly. Let's hope that Bloodyshade will implement it in the official version of Custom instead of wasting his time "fixing" "translation errors" that are not really errors!

Sixth commit:
- The pokeball change was not working correctly and is fixed now.
- The aggravate monster change was not working correctly and is fixed now.

Fifth commit:
- Added a (fake) DYWYPI prompt when the character dies.

Fourth commit:
- Renamed the "godly" string from pseudo-identified items to "ubergodly" to remove the issue where it's easy to mistake them for useless "Good" items.
- Standard monster AI will perform ranged attacks at a distance of 7 squares. I can't believe that custom AI limitation existed for the regular monster AI too, but apparently it did, so I could just have killed Utima early by keeping 6-7 squares distance, dismissing all the pets, and plugging away with my gun until Utima is dead. I won't have such cheesy tactics in *my* game, thank you very much.

1.73-specific:
- Re-inserted the old method of determining how many small medals the player gets for completing a random dungeon. But the new method that awards fixed amounts for high-difficulty dungeons is still there, too.

Third commit:
- Healing and Meditation skills will always train when they should. It is completely arbitrary bullshit that they just wouldn't train when your (irrelevant) constitution/magic stat was lower than the skill value, no other skill is treated like that AFAIK, and if it is, I will fix it for whatever other skills afflicted by this disease, too!

Second commit:
- Added a periodic chime noise if the player's gauge meter is full. This is far from perfect, but previously there was no indication at all that you had reached your maximum gauge!
- Low hitpoint warning sound happens when below 50% max HP, since below 25% was way too low. There are things that can kill you in two hits and not everyone is OCD enough to constantly keep a close eye on that not-really-very-obvious-when-it-decreases HP bar! Why can't we simply have a hit point bar *directly underneath our character sprite* just like stethoscoped pets do???
- Aggravate monster will spawn monsters based on the level of whoever is wearing an item with that effect because there's no reason to rubberband it to the player character's level.
- "Rare" items that may sometimes be generated as starting inventories of certain monsters are rare again. See comment below about rare drops.
- Items with "protects you from thieves" protects you from the malicious hand too because seriously, that bullshit needs to be stopped. If I'm protected from thieves then I expect to be fucking protected from thieves! The property is rare enough already, I won't accept it if it doesn't work!
- Remove the fucked up "anti-savescumming" feature. Sorry, dear developer, I'm not the kind of player you had in mind when you designed that "feature". And besides, your "feature" hurts non-savescumming players too by penalizing them for saving and loading the game often - you don't always have that much time for playing in one block, and I in particular don't want to leave the game running when I'm afk for a longer period of time since my PC has a habit of crashing and I don't want to lose my savegame file! And you want to penalize me for that every time, by making it so that I get 10 minutes of "no good item can ever drop"? Seriously???
- Custom AI pets can attack at a range of up to 7 squares. I'll never understand the reasoning for that completely arbitrary limit, much less that the one who introduced it is vehemently defending it. Goodbye, silly restriction, remove your fat ass from my beloved game or I will remove it permanently! Oh wait, I just did. Good riddance. :P
- Memorization un-trashed by making it affect dreams, wonder scrolls and mana battery again. Whoever thought it was a good idea to trash a skill that was already not very useful to begin with??? I mean, the amount it increses spell stock gain isn't great even now, but at least it's more than zero! Dear original developer, I guess you don't like the nether wave spell for some reason but I do!
- Pokeballs work when the monster is below 20% health (was 10%). It was just too damn annoying to whittle down the monster without killing it, I know there's the knockout feat but I feel it shouldn't be such a pain in the butt without it.
- Don't permanently remove act 1 void lords from the list once the player reaches act 2. How many players would enter the void before offing Zeome, anyway? It just seems very silly to limit a bunch of bosses like that, since few players would ever encounter them.

First commit:
- Skill/spell/stat potential decreases by 15% when they go up (used to be 21% but that was just way too fast, it shouldn't be that you pump up the potential to 400% and then it's all gone after upping the skill three times or so). Training a skill via platinum coins gives 50% more potential (used to be 100%). Sleeping restores spell potentials by 25% (used to be 30%). Pets that train their skills by spending money in town will receive considerably less training, since it was simply too easy for them to max out their potentials later on due to the costs never going up no matter how high their skills become.
- All monsters can always use gauge attacks, even when not playing in No Future mode (am I the only one who thinks the name changes they made to the modes are really bullshit? "Loss" or "Abnormal" just sound stupid, sorry!).
- Some shops can now stock "bad" items like potions of confusion or scrolls of inferior material.
- Acid damage can always destroy equipment if it gets damaged enough, even when not playing in No Future mode. After all, you'd have to be quite the noob to let your kickass artifact get hit by acid that many times, so if you do, you deserve to lose it.
- Spellcasting success chance can always reach 100%, no matter how heavy the player's equipment is and no matter what kind of equipment is in the second hand slot. Because I really HATE HATE HATE that bloody cap that basically forced me into using light armor and only a single melee weapon without a shield. To compensate, the spellcasting success rate is lowered even more with medium/heavy armor now, but at least now the penalty can eventually be overcome with enough skill!
- The Disarm Trap skill will train much more quickly. Seriously, did anyone except me ever notice how ultra-slowly it trains since there's no feasible way to farm traps considering how rare they are? I used to resort to dragging a tame mine dog along to generate mines to disarm, one should really not have to do that to raise the skill...
- The player no longer loses their equipment upon death. That always ticked me off to no end! Whose ingenious idea was it to make it so that you could just randomly lose that sentient weapon you spent hundreds of hours to level, or that precious item that would require you to farm 10 big daddies to get back? And why didn't they make it possible to turn that bullshit off??? I mean, I get it that if you somehow get stuck with a bloodsucking item that will simply kill you again, the chance of dropping it upon death might be a lifesaver, but... I say the possibility of such a situation is a small price to pay for what is ultimately going to make the game much more enjoyable. Heck, I committed actual cheating to work around the problem of dropping (and thereby permanently losing) my items when I died in the wilderness. This is my variant, and I decide what it's supposed to be like. Call me a cheater, I don't care!
- "Rare" drops by certain enemies actually are rare again. I remember a version where it used to be something special to get an unknown shell, a happy bed, or a secret experience of Kumiromi. But somehow the devs decided to make those drops ultra common. Should it really be that everyone has an unknown shell by XL5 and half a dozen happy beds by XL20? Nope, I say!
- Reverted some of the bloody "fixes" to certain "spelling errors". The curased coffin shall forever be spelled "curased coffin", and everyone who disagrees with me shall be put in a curased coffin as well! Just kidding :P Also reinstated the "yerles conbat plane" spelling.
- Replaced the broken "keh-la keh-la keh-la keh-la keh-la keh-la" bullshit that would permanently remove my metal pianist's superb magic resistance with no way to get it back. Now, that dream instead increases the ether corruption. Here's a very big middle finger to whoever created that creepy dream. Your silliness will never hurt my metal pianist again.
- Nerfed violent garden damage by dividing it by 10. It's just ridiculous how overpowered that action is, I started dubbing it "screen-wide total annihilation" because that's what it is. Rogue ambush? Just spam it a couple of times and all the flunkies are dead. Spam it some more and chances are the rogue boss will also expire before your stamina does. Like, did they even test it when they put it into the game??? No special action should be that strong, I even started to avoid the magical plants feat on purpose to ensure the game doesn't become too easy...
- Buying additional limbs at Gavela has a fixed cost because seriously, what were they thinking??? Penalizing the player for eating their hero cheese early is just so incredibly retarded, and the strategy would devolve into "stock up on hero cheese without eating them, buy limb, then eat them to get the lost life back", plus it would mean debug races with high starting Life wouldn't really benefit all that much of their high stat since it's all lost when buying more limbs. No longer, I say!
- The corpse of musical notadpoles conveys sound resistance. It really made no sense that there wasn't a single monster that did so while all other resistances can be gotten that way.
